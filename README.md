# HTML_CSS_Refactor

I modified the HTML  to semantic HTML, added accessibility to website, and made the CSS more efficient.

## The Purpose for this project 

the purpose is to refactor the HTML to be semantic HTML and add accessibitlity to the website.  Also to consolidate the CSS


## Status

I refactored before I made the readme file, and before I made my repo on github.  So, at this point, I'm working on the README file and learning markdown.

## Code

this project is in HTML and CSS

## Screenshots

## Process

First I changed the some of the div's to header, section, & footers.  Then I worked on the nav section, by adding the ID to the search enging optimization section.  Then started on the CSS, by condensing the repeated code.

## Code Example

<div></div> 
<div></div>
<div></div>

<header></header>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
